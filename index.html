I am a PhD Candidate at University of North Carolina Charlotte working with Dr. Erik Saule.
My research revolves around machine learning, text mining, and large graph mining.  
 - In social media analysis, my focus is on sentiment analysis, misinformation propagation, and community clustering. 
 - In graph theory, I concentrate on graph embedding on homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs in various fields, including social sciences (friendship networks, collaboration networks), community detection, link prediction, and node classification and visualization.
