I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, working with Dr. Erik Saule. 
My primary research interest lies in **Graph Mining**, *Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **social media mining and analysis**. 
My research agenda is based on three pillars:
====== \\
* May 22, 2025: Senior Program Committee (SPC) of ICWSM 2026.
<!--  * Graph Representation Learning 
  Developing models to understand and extract meaningful structures from complex networks, including analyzing downstream tasks such as community detection, link prediction, and node classification and visualization.

* Applied Machine Learning for Social Impact
  Leveraging NLP and network science to analyze real-world problems such as transportation safety, hate speech detection, and misinformation using social media and scholarly data.

* Bias, Fairness, and Trust in Scholarly and Social Networks 
  Investigating disparities in collaboration patterns, author networks, and online discourse using graph- and NLP-based techniques to uncover hidden bias and promote equitable systems.
