I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, working with Dr. Erik Saule.  
My research revolves around machine learning, text mining, and large graph mining.

#### Research Interests

**My research agenda is based on three pillars:**

- **Graph Representation Learning**  
  Developing models to understand and extract meaningful structures from complex networks, including analyzing downstream tasks such as community detection, link prediction, and node classification and visualization.

- **Applied Machine Learning for Social Impact**  
  Leveraging NLP and network science to analyze real-world problems such as transportation safety, hate speech detection, and misinformation using social media and scholarly data.

- **Bias, Fairness, and Trust in Scholarly and Social Networks**  
  Investigating disparities in collaboration patterns, author networks, and online discourse using graph- and NLP-based techniques to uncover hidden bias and promote equitable systems.
