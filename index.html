I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, working with Dr. Erik Saule. 
My primary research interest lies in Graph Mining, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Social Media Mining and Analysis. 
My research agenda is based on three pillars:

- Graph Representation Learning 
- Applied Machine Learning for Social Impact
- Bias, Fairness, and Trust in Scholarly and Social Networks 

What else do you need?

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
