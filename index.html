My primary research interest lies in **computational social science (CSS)**, **natural language processing (NLP)**, **social
media mining and analysis**. We now live in a world where we can reach people directly through social media without relying on traditional media such as television and radio. On the other hand, social media platforms collect vast amounts of data and create very specific profiles of different users
through targeted advertising. While effective in enhancing content relevance, *microtargeting* poses risks of manipulating user behavior, creating echo chambers, and fostering polarization. My research vision is to understand ***microtargeting*** and ***activity patterns*** on social media
by developing computational approaches and frameworks blending CSS, NLP, and artificial intelligence (AI).
