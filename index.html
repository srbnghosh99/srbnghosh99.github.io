I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, advised by Dr. Erik Saule.  
My research lies at the intersection of machine learning, text mining, and large-scale graph mining.

### Research Interests

**My research agenda is grounded in three pillars:**

- **Graph Representation Learning**  
  Developing models to capture and analyze complex structures in networks, with applications in community detection, link prediction, node classification, and visualization.

- **Applied Machine Learning for Social Impact**  
  Combining NLP and network science to tackle real-world challenges such as transportation safety, hate speech detection, and misinformation, particularly through the lens of social media and scholarly data.

- **Bias, Fairness, and Trust in Scholarly and Social Networks**  
  Studying inequalities in research collaboration and online discourse using graph-based and NLP techniques to expose structural bias and support equitable systems.
