I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, working with Dr. Erik Saule. 
My primary research interest lies in Graph Mining, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Social Media Mining and Analysis. 
My research agenda is based on three pillars:

- Graph Representation Learning to analyze large graph for downstream task such as link prediction, node classification and community clustering. 
- Scitometrics to analyze scholarly big data for collaboration network to understand collaboration pattern, influential scholars and bias & disparities in-terms of gender and race. 
- Social Media Mining to understand impact of social media on railsafety, presidential election and convid-19 events on misinformation propagation, sentiment, emotion and hashtag analysis.  



### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
